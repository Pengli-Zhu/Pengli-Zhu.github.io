#### About

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at ShanghaiTech University, under the supervision of Prof. [Qian Wang (王乾)](https://qianwang.space/). I also earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the same institution. In the next phase of my academic journey, I will join The Hong Kong Polytechnic University to pursue a Ph.D. under the guidance of Prof. [Anqi Qiu (仇安琪)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/mhrc/people/mhrc-people/prof-qiu-anqi/?sc_lang=tc).

#### Research

My current research focuses on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for medical image analysis, leveraging MLLMs to enable more reliable and naturally interactive computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), report generation, and medical image synthesis. Previously, I have also worked extensively in natural image processing, including multi-view object tracking and 3D human reconstruction. I have published serveral papers about medical image and computer vision with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UR1eH9cAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FAbsterZhu%2FAbsterZhu.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.
